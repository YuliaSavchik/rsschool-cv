### Code example:       
   
**Get the Middle Character KATA from CODEWARS:** *You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.*  
```javascript   
function getMiddle(s)  
{  
   if(s.length % 2 == 0) {  
        let symbol = s.length / 2  
        return s[symbol -1] + s[symbol]  
    }  
    else if(s.length % 2 == 1) {  
        let symbol = Math.ceil(s.length / 2)  
        return s[symbol - 1]  
    }  
}  
```   
    
**Jaden Casing Strings KATA from CODEWARS:** *Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.*    
```javascript     
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {  
  let stringArr = this.toLowerCase().split(' ')  
  let newStr = ''  
  for(let i = 0; i < stringArr.length; i++){  
      let word = stringArr[i]  
      let letterOne = word[0].toUpperCase()  
      let letters = word.substring(1, word.length)  
      newStr += letterOne + letters + ' '  
    }  
  return newStr.trim()  
}  
```    
    
**Disemvowel Trolls KATA from CODEWARS:** *Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.*   
```javascript    
function disemvowel(str) {  
  str = str.replace(/a|e|i|o|u/gi, '')  
  return str  
}  
```
